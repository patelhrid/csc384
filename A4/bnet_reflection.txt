1. Explain what the calculations above might or might not tell you about the "fairness" of your Naive Bayesian network. Explain in 50-100 words.

The calculations provided are evaluating the performance of the Naive Bayesian network in predicting salaries based
on various demographic factors. The fairness of the model might be assessed by examining whether the predictions are
consistent across different gender groups. For instance, questions 3 and 4 compare the predictions for women and men,
considering the influence of gender on the prediction accuracy. If there are significant disparities between these
groups, it may suggest bias in the model, indicating potential fairness concerns.




2. Would you be willing to use your model to recommend starting salaries for employees at a firm? Why or why not? Explain in 50-100 words.

I would be cautious about using the model to recommend starting salaries for employees at a firm. While the Naive
Bayesian network may capture some patterns in the data, it simplifies complex relationships and assumes independence
between variables. This could lead to inaccurate predictions, especially if factors influencing salaries are more
nuanced. Additionally, fairness considerations should be thoroughly evaluated before using the model for making salary
recommendations to avoid perpetuating biases present in the training data.
